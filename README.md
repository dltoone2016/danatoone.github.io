I have setup this GitHub accoutn for the first time today. This is all a new and exciting thing. 

This Respository was created as part of a lab for CTI-110 

I followed the instructions given to me by my teacher. Once I downloaded the GitHub desktop onto my computer I wass able to sign in and I didn't find the + icon to clone the repository but I did go to file and select clone repository, selected my repository which was named danatoone.github.io, I chose the location as to where I wanted it stored in this case it was in the folder we created on my hard drive a few labs back, selected clone respository and it downloaded a copy to my preselected location.
